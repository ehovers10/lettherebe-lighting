Eureka! The best ideas have a penchant of arising spontaneously when you least expect them. It is said that Archimedes discovered the relation of displaced water to the volume of an object floating in it while taking a bath. Another of Archimedes' water-related ideas was a way of trasporting it uphill by means of a spiral structure. We call his subsequent invention Archimedes' Screw.

This lamp evokes surprise inspiration, with light emerging from an unexpected source. The design harkens to Archimedes' wondrous water-related discoveries.
