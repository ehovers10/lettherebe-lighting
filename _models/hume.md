Is it possible to form an idea of something of which you have had no experience whatsoever? As an empiricist, David Hume thought that all ideas have their ultimate origin in experience. But he acknowledged that perhaps one could form an idea of a particular shade of blue that one has never seen by extrapolating it from experience of other shades that resemble it. Is this a genuinely creative act of the mind?

This lamp mimics Hume's missing shade of blue. An idea emerges from a concrete structure, but it is apparently suspended by its own power.
