*Quod est ante pedes nemo spectat, caeli scrutantur plagas.* The poet Ennis thus describes the plight of the philosopher -- No one sees what is at their feet, when searching out the regions of the sky. The great pre-Socratic philosopher, Thales, was the butt of many jokes for supposedly falling into a well while gazing up, contemplating the stars. Thales famously held that water was the one fundamental element, with all else merely water in different form.

This lamp evokes Thales' grand unification, with water, air, earth, and fire coming together for one cause. The gate-valve releases an apparent stream of water, which flows up through the earthly metals and rises into the air, finally to spark a fire, and perhaps wonder.
