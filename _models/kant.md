Why is there something rather than nothing? Perhaps we owe our existence, as well as that of the entire cosmos, to the creative act of a super-powerful being or two. Or maybe what we take to be our universe is just one among innumerable others. Immanuel Kant felt that the human mind was fated to know nothing but phenomena. The world as it is in itself, the neumenal, is something to which, in principle, we do not have access.

This lamp represents the epistemic position of humanity, existing upon a small globe in the midst of the vast cosmos, the origin of which is hidden from us. To reach outside of that box and see what it all rests upon is the ultimate metaphysical yen.
