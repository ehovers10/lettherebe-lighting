  description: 
    Why is there something rather than nothing? Perhaps we owe our existence, as well as 
    that of the entire cosmos, to the creative act of a super-powerful being or two. Or 
    maybe what we take to be our universe is just one among innumerable others.
    This lamp represents the epistemic position of humanity, existing upon a small globe 
    in the midst of the vast cosmos, the origin of which is hidden from us. To reach 
    outside of that box and see what it all rests upon is the ultimate metaphysical yen.
